/**
 *	Location Subsystem.
 *
 * DANGER: This is in the process of being gutted and replaced with the DifferentialDriveOdometry
 * class which uses a different frame of reference.
 * There are two implementations of location tracking in this file. The old-style is used for
 * the vision processing. The new style is used for the RamseteController for auto driving.
 * In the 2020 offseason the plan is to remove the old style and update the vision driving to
 * use the style. This is not scheduled to happen during the 2020 build season, so both implementations
 * are left in this file to smooth the transition to new new Ramsete driving code.
 *
 * The location subsystem is responsible for tracking the location of the robot on the field.
 * It does this through reading the encoders and the gyro and plotting where the robot has moved.
 * This is guaranteed lossy, as we cannot update often enough to track every slight movement.
 * 
 * Coordinate system
 * -----------------
 * 
 * The field orientation has the Y axis across the driver's station and
 * the X axis between the alliance's ends.
 * Positive for Y is from right to left, and positive for X is towards the
 * opposite alliance's end from the driver's station.
 *  
 * X is along the "horizontal line", and Y is the "vertical" line with 
 * (0,0) at the center of the diagram below.
 *

 * 
 * The location subsystem works in headings and bearings. When the robot starts we call the forward direction heading/bearing 0.
 * 
 * A heading is the angle that the robot has moved from the initial angle.
 * It can range from -infinity to infinity, so full circles change the heading by 360 degrees each time.
 * Increasing positive angles are the robot turning anticlockwise.
 * 
 * A bearing is the relative angle from the initial angle. In nautical terms it is the absolute bearing.
 * A bearing is constrained to the range -180 to 180 degrees.
