/**
 * The location system is responsible for tracking the location of the robot on the field.
 * It does this through reading the encoders and the gyro and plotting where the robot has moved.
 * This is guaranteed lossy, as we cannot update often enough to track every slight movement, and
 * undetected movements may occur, such as slippage of the wheels.
 * 
 * The location subsystem works in headings and bearings. When the robot starts we call the forward direction heading/bearing 0.
 * 
 * A heading is the angle that the robot has moved from the initial angle.
 * It can range from -infinity to infinity, so full circles change the heading by 360 degrees each time.
 * 
 * A bearing is the relative angle from the initial angle. In nautical terms it is the absolute bearing.
 * A bearing is constrained to the range -180 to 180 degrees.
 * 
 * The location subsystem is also responsible for keeping track of where the robot was on the field.
 * It can be asked for the historical location of the robot. We do not have to keep history from the start of the match,
 * only the last number of seconds.
 * 
 * The Location system is an independent entity within the drive code. It is implemented to obtain information from sources,
 * possibly including gyros, the drivebase, other sensors, maybe even video and keep track of the robot's position at all times.
 * It also need to be able to return where the robot was at some time in the past.
 * This allows the code to work out relative angles to external objects based on current and historical positions (and through projection, future positions).
