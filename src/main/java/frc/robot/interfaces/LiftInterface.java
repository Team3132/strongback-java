/*
 * The 2018 robot has a dual purpose lift.
 * In Lift mode its purpose is to raise and lower the intake/outtake device to allow us to pick up and deliver cubes.
 * in climb mode it allows us to raise the robot up the scale.
 * 
 * There are various sensors on the lift mechanism, a top and bottom stop indicator,
 * as well there is a sensor that will tell us how high the lift is currently.
 * 
 * The lift subsystems runs a state machine to raise and lower the lift autonomously.
